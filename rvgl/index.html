	<h2 id="download">1. Download and set up RVGL</h2>
	<h3>Windows / Mac / Linux</h3>
	<div class="section">
		<p>If you're playing on PC, go get the <a href="https://re-volt.gitlab.io/rvgl-launcher/">RVGL Launcher</a>!</p>
		<p>When you run it it will show a screen saying <tt>The game doesn't seems to be installed.</tt> From here, you want to select Install Type: Standard (the default) and Game Preset: Online. Then click Download and Install.</p>
		<p>Once the install is complete, you'll see various information on the Game tab. Above the Lunch RVGL button there's a Launch Parameters box. Enter the following in there:</p>
		<p><tt>-nointro -pass funky</tt></p>
		<p>The password will change every stream, so replace <tt>funky</tt> with whatever it says on stream!</p>
		<p>Now go to the Repositories tab and in the input field at the bottom enter <tt>https://kadalyn.live/rvgl/schedule.json</tt> then click Add Repository.</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Android</h3>
	<div class="section">
		<p>If you're playing on Android you'll need to download and install the APK listed <a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/releases/rvgl_full_android_original.apk">here</a>.</p>
		<p>To install it, click the completed download from your browser's notification. Android will warn you that your browser isn't allowed to install APKs and take you to the permission screen to enable it. Do so. Once installed, you may disable it again.</p>
		<p>Run the application once, set your profile name, and close it. This will create an RVGL folder. It will attempt to create it on your SD card first, and otherwise on your main device storage. You'll have to go find this with a file manager, such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cxinventor.file.explorer">Cx File Explorer</a>.</p>
		<p>Now download the following additional packs:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/io_cars.zip">io_cars</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/io_music.zip">io_music</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/io_skins.zip">io_skins</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/io_tracks.zip">io_tracks</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/io_soundtrack.zip">io_soundtrack</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/io_clockworks.zip">io_clockworks</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://distribute.re-volt.io/packs/io_clockworks_modern.zip">io_clockworks_modern</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Unzip these to the RVGL folder you found. If it asks to overwrite anything, check the "Apply to all" box and select skip (that is, don't overwrite anything!).</p>
		<p>Now download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux">Termux</a> and run it. This will open a (potentially intimidating) terminal interface.</p>
		<p>In this interface, use this command to start RVGL (instead of tapping the icon!):</p>
		<p><tt>am start -n com.rvgl.rvgl/.RVGLActivity -e args "-nointro -lobby kadalyn.rv.gl -pass funky"</tt></p>
		<p>The password will change every stream, so replace <tt>funky</tt> with whatever it says on stream!</p>
		<p>When you want to play solo, you can just tap the icon instead of going through Termux.</p>
	</div>

	<h2 id="controls">2. Set up your controls</h2>

	<h2 id="join">3. Joining the lobby</h2>
	<div class="section">
		<p>Make sure you've updated the password before joining!</p>
		<p>If you added the repo on PC, go to the Events tab, click on my event, then click Join Kadalyn.</p>
		<p>If you didn't use the -lobby parameter or set up the repo, you'll have to go to Start Race → Multi-Player → Join Game and then enter <tt>kadalyn.rv.gl</tt></p>
		<p>Once it starts up, just select Join Game.</p>
		<p>If your connection is immediately rejected, make sure your client is up to date, that you have entered the correct password, and you have the right packs (unmodified).</p>
		<p>Now enter your name (ideally the name you're chatting with on YouTube!) and select a car based on the day's limitations (it will say on stream).</p>
		<p>Now select Waiting Room if you wish to play.</p>
		<p>You'll see a list of participants. The top-most player will reiterate the limits of the day's races.</p>
		<p>!! Please obey the same chat rules as on YouTube if you decide to chat !!</p>
